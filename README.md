Here are some of the coding projects I've worked on:

- [Senior Thesis Code](Thesis_Network_FinalCode.ipynb/) - For my senior thesis at Harvard, I collected undirected, directed, and weighted network data from a real organization, created a network statistics calculator to efficiently process it, and developed new metrics using the network statistics to analyze the network in an newly quantitative way. The full thesis can be read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11TFFW09H3pMyNrFZEa4-ORIp7PtXoHreAtGVI-HHXyo/edit?usp=sharing). 
- [Project 2](project2/) - Description of Project 2.
