Here are some of the coding projects I've worked on:

- [Senior Thesis Code](Thesis_Network_FinalCode.ipynb/) - For my senior thesis at Harvard, I collected undirected, directed, and weighted network data from a real organization, created a network statistics calculator to efficiently process it, and developed new metrics using the network statistics to analyze the network in an newly quantitative way.
- [Project 2](project2/) - Description of Project 2.
